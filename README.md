# Motivations
I improved themes I like to use on my iPod Mini 2G to fix bugs and better fit my needs. I did not made those themes from scratch, I am just using them and applying a few improvements/bug fixes to improve my user experience.
I think this work may benefit to the community, so I share it in the hope that this will be useful to someone in the vast Internet.

# Minit b4 by yuuiko
Improvements made by me : 
- Use the font "Sazanami" 11px only in menus to show more lines and content on screen which helps you at navigation especially if you have a large library

Bug fixes made by me : 
- Fixed a missing space between the Month name and the day of month in the lockscreen when music is playing (there is 2 different lockscreen, one that show if music is playing and another that show when there's no music to play. On the second one, there was nothing to fix, it was correct.)
- Fix to the glitchy lockscreen each time a new song is played in the background while staying on the lockscreen (I inspired myself from the code of this theme https://github.com/D0-0K/adwaitapod to figure out how to fix it).
- Fix multiple issues that could cause the lockscreen to glitch out

This theme already supports japanese characters just fine out of the box.

# Sprocket by gogi-goji
Improvements made by me : 
- Add important fonts in the package
- Use the font "Rockbox-Mix" on the WPS screen to support japanese characters
- Use the font "11-Sazanami-Mincho" in menus to print more lines and support japanese characters everywhere
- Enable scrollbar on the right of the screen
- Use a pointer for selections to enhance readability
- If no sleep timer is configured, the current clock (hour + minutes) will be shown on the bottom-center of the WPS screen so you can know what time is it just by looking your screen at any time without having to fiddle in menus

Bug fixes made by me : 
- Clear any previous wallpaper when applying the theme

# Sprocket or Minit ?
Sprocket can't show album arts but it show much more info on the WPS screen. Sprocket is simple and clean.

Minit is gorgeous especially if you have album covers for most or all of your songs. Using a script like this one works great at building optimized covers that the Mini will not struggle to show : https://github.com/Xpl0itU/rockbox_scripts/blob/master/album_art_fix.py
Minit even has a lockscreen if you lock your iPod while being in the homescreen, and that lockscreen is showing the current date and time which can be very useful.
